Sunshine Watch Face
===================================

This is a watchface I made for the Udacity sample app [Sunshine](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine-Version-2). The watch face syncs weather data from the app and displays it on your android wear watch.

# What I Learned

This app taught me a lot about the play servies apis. It was definately a challenge working with such a small device. But over I learned how to use onDraw to add simple graphics to views and that has helped try to make my own UI animations.
